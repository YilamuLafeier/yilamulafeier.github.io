I am excited to learn the basics of software engineering. Creating software has always been an interest of mine since I was given my first computer (an old IBM laptop my dad patched up). While my career plan revolves around cybersecurity, I am also interested in freelance developing work. Of course, I would like to merge both interests together; I, however, am open to projects of any kind. Eventually, my goal is to develop useful software for different platforms. This is to say, I am not exactly sure what my eventual goal should exactly be, but I know software engineering is a skill I wish to hone. 

I am hoping this software engineering course will prepare me for not only the coding aspect of Computer Science, but the career-focused aspect. Building a Linkedin, creating this portfolio, and even learning about slack-these were all things I would not know where to start on. Having this course as guidance is helping to ease these worries. The workload is still daunting, unfortunately, but my resolve is set. I would like to leave this semester with a better hold on my coding skills as well as an improvement in my study habits. The WODs allow me exercise and the resources provided on the ICS 314 website were helpful in following a structured lesson schedule. The general course structure is engaging as well. I feel as though the lectures are useful in both learning and retaining information.
