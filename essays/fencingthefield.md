# Fencing the field

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When our group began to work on our track sheet, I was not entirely sure what would serve as the basis for my estimation. Estimations create constraints, in turn creating pressure. There was some anxiety in boxing myself, however, I decided to make guesses based on how comfortable I was with the task at hand in increments of 10 minutes. The less comfortable I was, the more time I would add to offset research. It was not scientific by any means but it gave me a realistic goal. Admittedly, towards the end I had gotten lazier with the process. The general thought pattern, however, remained. <br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite the inaccuracy of the estimations, as mentioned above it offered a timeframe. My achilles heel has always been independent time management. This is not to say that I am incapable of using my time wisely, but I do struggle with the initial approach. Having a timer called back to the WOD practices done in-class; it was a familiar experience. In fact, working within self-imposed constraints gave me better insight on my abilities allowing me to be lazier with my later estimations. <br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All I really need is a push. Some condition or pressure to at least get the ball rolling. Giving myself an idea on how I should approach something with respect to time allows me to formulate an action plan more efficiently. Applying the thought process more often helps it grow as well; the more it’s used the better you’ll get at an accurate estimation. Moving forward, charting out the flow would allow for better standardization and analysis making room for additional efficiency.
