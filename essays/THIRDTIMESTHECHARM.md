Software engineering was never quite a large interest for me. While I’ve always found myself erring on the side of security and hardware, the flow of a project while ‘engineering a software’, so to speak, offers valuable tools for proper project organization and communication. Not to mention, the course helps prepare students like myself for entering the industry. Such knowledge and experience allow for students to have some basis before considering internships and their upper-level courses.

This is my third time taking ICS 314. While I am not particularly proud of it, it has given me a better appreciation for the process of software engineering on whole. There is an art in the (successful) execution of each teammate’s role, communication, and timing/deadlines. Such coordination is important outside of programming as well. Learning the fundamentals of web programming gives you a skillset that carries over into the future as well. 

In my past experience, this takes a lot of time and careful planning. With time being a rather precious resource for me as of right now in between work and classes, my past couple attempts at this course fizzled out. With this attempt, despite its weak start, I am determined to do the best I can without failing the course.
