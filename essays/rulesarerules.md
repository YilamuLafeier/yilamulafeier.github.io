# Rules Are Rules
<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To put it as simply as possible, ESLint is tedious. Every aspect of the code is rigid to a standard that demands full clarity. This is not to say that it is a negative ruleset, just one that requires attention. For it to sound the alarms to something small as indentation or spacing can be rather frustrating at times; the code produced is, at least, readable. As much as there is to critique, it still produces legible code (regardless of whether it works or not). 
<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I, personally, despise sifting through messy code. I also, however, produce plenty of messy code. With my irrational avoidance of comments wreaking havoc to clarity, it’s nice to have a safeguard that can keep my code traversable. I will admit, back tracking every now and then to fix an ESLint violation can frustrate me – especially if my code is refusing to work (I did NOT use AI and I simply like em dashes. I REFUSE to let AI take this from me). Despite this, I ultimately see no reason to avoid ESLint. Perhaps if it encumbers you more than it supports, though that is more a question of personal taste.
