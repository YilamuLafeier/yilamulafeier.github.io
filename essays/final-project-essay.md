# Campus Connect
## Proposers:
- Yilamu Lafeier (Raf)
- Rhys Dhustin Ocana
## Overview
The problem: Networking suffers a paradox: It is harder than ever in today's massively interconnected age, especially among new and transfer college students. With the world suffering from virtual insanity, there is an incentive to stay indoors and online. So how do we, as students, create meaningful connections without completely forgoing technolgy? 
<br/>
<br/>
The solution: A platform built for college students, by college students designed to connect like minded people across campus. Users can customize a profile to either display an introduction or to advertise networking opportunities. A calendar feature can organize all events based on filters for easy access to information. Profiles can include interests, majors, personal introductions, and more. 
<br/>
<br/>

## Approach And Use Cases
The platform would include (a):
- Landing page
- Login page
- Messages (Pen Pal Style)
- Profile page
- Calendar of events
- Admin control panel

Users can make use of the platform in different ways:
- A landing page will display relevant users as potential connections
- Users will login through the login page and be directed straight to the landing page
- Instead of messaging made instant, users will have to send "eSnailMail"; slower messages meant to encourage meeting/communicating outside the platform. The platfom is designed to get users off of it
- A profile page will allow users to view/edit their name, introductins, interests, and more. There will be a button to message a user on every profile
- A Calendar will allow students to view information and events in an organized manner. May allow club leaders to advertise
- Admin control panel options are granted to organizations, club leaders, or moderators to add events to the calendar, recruit students, or even remove problematic/unrelated users. Users must currently be a UH Student

## Beyond the Basics
- Integration with companies outside of college system
- Initially designed for just CS, intent to expand to other majors/departments
- Expand to other campuses
- Push notifcation for events and messages
