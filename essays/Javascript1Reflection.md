   Coming into Computer Science a newbie has been overwhelming, to say the least. My experience with coding was minimal entering University, limited no further than a simple code that printed "Hello World" in C++. Now, however, my understanding for coding has grown tremendously. So far, I have already reviewed the basics of 5 languages: Python, Java, C, C++, and now Javascript.
	Javascript reminded me of learning Python in the sense that both languages are, at least to myself, not as difficult than most other languages.
