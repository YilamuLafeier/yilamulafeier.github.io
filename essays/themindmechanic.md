# The Mind Mechanic
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With whichever direction AI goes, controversy is sure to follow. This makes the ever increasing debates regarding AI’s role in education rather unsurprising. Both sides of the fence claim that their grass is greener leaving much of the discourse to fall victim to absolutes. In reality, there is a grey area AI lies in: not quite a standalone solution, however, it remains as a tool that may assist with redundant tasks. Existing in a half-state, akin to fungi, AI has the potential to either rot its users or offer valuable assistance. With the direction the tech industry is heading, AI is becoming an increasingly relevant player. Despite concerns that AI may just be a bubble, it has been integrated into workflows quite rapidly. Software engineers and management teams alike have used AI tools; usage can range from assistance with code building/review to sifting through thousands of resumes and portfolios. Personally, I have used AI as a tool for very specific queries or to help me avoid skimming through hundreds of pages of documentation. Typically I use GitHub Copilot as its integration into my workflow allows for context when I have a question. There is, however, a line I do not cross: allowing AI to deny me the opportunity to create.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AI can steal the very soul from a person. It sits in a cave like a wise oracle, assisting pilgrims who seek answers. Advertised as a free service, it learns with each visit till one day you will be greeted by your own face peering out the cave. This is not to say that it can serve as a utility, however, it should never be allowed to replace human thought. Of each of the listed course elements is a brief description of my usage:
<br/><br/>

* Experience WODs e.g. E18 <br/>
    * I used AI as more of a refined Google search, allowing me to move through my confusion faster. This was to practice my speed with coding blind allowing me to avoid spending too much time browsing the web. GiHub Copilot was the AI I would use. Prompts would be along the lines of "In the BootCamp 5 documentation there is information regarding navbars. Provide me a breakdown of what it says and how would it relate in context to my code?"<br/>
* In-class Practice WODs<br/>
    * All WODs treated the same. My approach was the same as 1).<br/>
* In-class WODs<br/>
    * Same as one and two.<br/>
* Essays<br/>
    * I have never and will never use AI for writing. I have always had a passion for writing and consider it almost offensive to have a machine write something that is meant to mimic a human’s creativity. <br/>
* Final Project<br/>
    * I used AI as a way to guide me through features I wanted to implement but did not know how to. There were times when dealing with the backend that I was so lost I had no idea where to start looking for answers. Using GitHub Copilot within VSCode saved me time from searching online and allowed my questions to be within context. 
* Learning a concept/tutorial
    *
