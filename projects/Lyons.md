summary: "A day clearing a field at the Lyon's Arboretum in Mānoa Valley."
---

  Tucked away in the recesses of O'ahu's Mānoa Valley, the Lyon Arboretum is a research unit funded by the Univerity of Hawai'i at Mānoa (UHM). Their work is geared towards the research and conservation of native plants. An opportunity to volunteer opened up halfway through my Fall 2023 semester in the form of an assignment for a sociology class of mine. Much of the work done by the small volunteer group I was a part of was pulling weeds from a clearing to offer more room for a rare native tree: the Koa tree.
