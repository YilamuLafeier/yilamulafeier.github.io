**[Brainbows](https://brainbows.today)** is a webapp designed to help bring students together. Many a time, students may find it difficult to study alone. Sometimes, camaraderie is appreciated during times of high stress (like finals!). Brainbows allows study sessions to be publicly (or privately) shared and joined. Students have the opportunity to reach out to any professors that are on the app as well. Professors will be able to set up office hours as study sessions.
