# What is this?
**[Rainbow Reclamation](https://rainbow-reclamation.vercel.app)** is a sinmple NextJS application that serves as a database of user-submitted lost items. Leaving items behind without knowing where to start working is a bummer at the very least. The power of a community coming together has unlimited potential; allowing a community to report and turn in lost items they come across centralizes the entire process and gives at the very least a place to start looking.
