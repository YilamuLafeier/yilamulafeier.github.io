Being able to successfully boot and run macOS on a machine designed to run Windows is one of my greatest and most challenging achievements yet. While against Apple's EULA, I learned a lot from the experience regarding computer hardware and OSes, and I gleaned a basic understanding of kernels. My discovery of "hackintoshing" is actually what pushed me to pursue an education in computer science in the first place. While I have not revisited the scene since a security patch broke my installation, I hope to work with similar topics in my career.

The entire endeavor took me a few months to get working smoothly. Using [Dortania's guide]([url](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/)https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/), I used the tools offered in the guide and essentially took a crash course on the subject.
